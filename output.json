For example, a corporation or government agency can require individuals to use only digital IDs issued by that agency to sign official documents.

When you certify a document, you can control the types of changes other people can make. In addition, both signature types comply with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signature (PAdES) standard. You can certify with or without displaying a signature. The default signing format, when set up accordingly, is compliant with Part 2 of the PAdES standard.
